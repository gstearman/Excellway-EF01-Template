# Excellway EF01 Project Box Cutting Template

`excellway-ef01-panel-template.pdn` is a customisable cutting template for the instrument panels on the popular Excellway EF01 plastic hobby project box [sold by Banggood.com](https://www.banggood.com/Electronic-Plastic-Shell-Cartridge-Handle-Project-Case-Desk-Instrument-200x175x70mm-p-1035473.html).

It is a [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net) image file containing a scale representation of an EF01 panel and a vareity of cutout template layers which can be copied and moved to create custom cutting/drilling templates. The template can then be printed 1:1 and taped on to the plastic panels for cutting/drilling.

I created this template when building an amateur radio transceiver kit and wanted to plan my instrument layout for the EF01 case I chose to use. An example of a finished case using this template is shown below:
